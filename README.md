# Gradient Descent Coding Challenge

This is the code for "Intro - The Math of Intelligence" by Siraj Raval on Youtube

# Dependencies 
numpy
pandas

# Dataset
The dataset consists of two variables distance travelled and calories burned.

# Overview

I have initialised the parameters to 0 and kept(learning rate) at 0.0001. 
In each iteration, I have updated the values of the parameters by subtracting the sumation of the partial derivative w.r.t to each parameter.
